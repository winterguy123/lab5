            <h2>Where is the Hemlock?</h2>
            <p>
                Poison Hemlock can typically be found in sunny areas, fields, and ditches. Hemlock plants have
                red/purple spots and streaks, and often grow up to 10 feet tall with small white 5 petal flowers.

            <h2>What does the Hemlock do?</h2>
            <p>
                Hemlock plants are very toxic. Even a small amount of hemlock being consumed can spell death to humans.
                If the plant is consumed, contact authorities quickly.
